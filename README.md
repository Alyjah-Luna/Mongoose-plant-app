# Mongoose-plant-app

I made this app to insert plants & the details about them. It has the name of the plant, as well as the type, where it originates from as well as the requirements that the plant needs.

<br>
It's lacking quite some style at the moment but I will work on that, I just wanted to focus on being able to get the app up & running with users to also interact with it. Using OAuth, the users will be able to add a plant, leave a comment if they wish about a specific plant & delete thier own comment or plant that they created.
